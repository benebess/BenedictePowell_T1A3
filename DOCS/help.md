# Installing 'TRY NOT TO DIE'

"Hello and thank you for being interested in downloading my application: Try Not To Die. 
The following is a detailed instruction manual on how to install my game!

STOP! - Please be sure you have Ruby installed on your computer before attempting the following steps. 
If you need help installing ruby please check out this link:

First you will need to clone my repo! 
Navigate in the command line to where you would like this file to be kept on your computer and then you can copy and paste this into your command line: 
```git clone git@github.com:benebess/BenedictePowell_T1A3.git```

Once the repo has successfully installed, use the command line to navigate to the src folder, you can copy and paste this: 
```cd src```

Once you are in this file you will need to install the gems that my application requires! If you haven't already, you will need to install bundler. Copy and paste this into your command line: 
``` gem install bundler```

If that has successfully installed, you can then bundle install all my applications gems, simply copy and paste this: 
``` bundle install```
these are the gems you will be installing by typing bundle install: 
*gem 'tty-prompt', '~> 0.23.1'*
*gem 'colorize', '~> 0.8.1'*
*gem 'rainbow', '~> 3.0'*
*gem 'asciiart', '~> 0.0.10'*
*gem 'artii', '~> 2.1', '>= 2.1.2'*



If you are using a mac, once you have the gems set up you can run: 
```./run_app.sh```
