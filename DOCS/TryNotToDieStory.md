ENTER NAME/PRONOUN

THE BEGINNING: 

It was a cold, dark night... A brisk breeze cuts through (#NAME)'s woolen coat and sends a shiver down (#pronoun) back. Following instructions scrawled across a ripped piece of paper, given to (#pronoun) by a colleague, (#NAME) walks down a seemingly quiet and unsuspecting street... in the distance, a figure is seen, illuminated by the street lights behind them... 
What do you want to do? 

1. escape down the manhole to your right *(GO TO: PT1CH1)*
2. run towards the figure *(GO TO: PT1CH2)*
3. cut through the park, it's dark but atleast it's not that weird figure *(GO TO: PT1CH3)*

PT.1 CH.1: 
"**escape down the manhole to your right**"
#{name} pulls the lid off the manhole and fumbles for the ladder, the brisk air has made #{name}'s hands cold and they fail to get a good grip, slipping and falling for what seems like hours... then the cold harsh slam of #{name}'s body echoes through the quiet streets above. #{name} HAS DIED. 

PT.1 CH.2: 
"**run towards the figure**"
#{name} has never been one to back down, picking up the pace they run directly towards the figure, the air bites at #{pronoun} cheeks but it doesn't slow them down. The figure stops and watches as #{name} gets closer, hauntingly un-moved by #{name} running toward them... As #{name} makes it within a few meters of the figure, #{name} can now see that it is an old man... the deep wrinkles in his face make him look like a broken porclain doll. #{name} stops in front of him, waiting for something... anything... The man clears his throat and asks whether #{name} can show him the way to his house nearby, #{name} looks down at the piece of paper in #{pronoun} hand... it's the same street name that the man has asked to go to...  
*What do you want to do?

1. tell the man you'd be happy to let him tag along on your journey *(GO TO: PT2CH2.1)*
2. say nothing and keep going on your way *(GO TO: PT2CH2.2)*
3. politely decline... this guy is creepy *(GO TO: PT2CH2.3)*

PT.1 CH.3: 
"**cut through the park, it's dark but atleast it's not that weird figure**"
Looking around,  #{name} see's a park to  #{pronoun} left, it's dark and the trees seem almost alive, but it seems better then the unknown at the end of the street,  #{name} runs into the park and down the cobblestone pathway... the park is quiet except for the rustle of the trees, and the odd hoot of an owl... The path leads through the park and comes out on the very street #{name} is looking for. There are a number of derelict houses on the left and a warehouse on the right... the street lights don't seem to have been serviced in years... it's very dark so making out the street numbers is proving difficult... a flashlight would be really handy right now... 
What do you want to do? 

1. blindly walk through the street, hoping to find what your looking for *(GO TO: PT3CH3.1)*
2. there was a dirty old bag back in the park, maybe it had a flash light? go check? *(GO TO: PT3CH3.2)*
3. check the warehouse, maybe someone is working late *(GO TO: PT3CH3.3)*

PT.2 CH.2.1
**tell the man you'd be happy to let him tag along on your journey**
#{name} smiles at the old man, gesturing to #{pronoun} paper, and says "Of course, I'm going the same way". The old man smiles back at #{name}. Walking down the street the man tells #{name} vague stories from his life as #{name} listens intently, the time passes quicker now that #{name} has company and the brisk air doesn't feel as cold anymore... Soon there comes a fork in the road, looking down at the piece of paper #{name} looks puzzled. The man says he thinks it's the road to the left, but mentions his memory is not what it used to be... 
*What do you want to do? 

1. follow the man's instructions, even if he seems unsure *(GO TO: PT4CH1.1)*
2. go the other way *(GO TO: PT4CH1.2)*

PT.2 CH.2.2
"**say nothing and keep going on your way**"
The man watches you walk away, a sad look in his eyes. (#name) turns away and continues down the street... out of nowhere a car appears and slams into (#name). Thrown far from the road (#pronoun) hits (#pronoun) head on the edge of a cement garden bed. (#name) HAS DIED. 

PT.2 CH.2.3
"**politely decline... this guy is creepy**"
The man nods, shoulders slumping, he walks wearily down the street towards the park. (#name) shrugs off the interaction and looks around... (#name) notices a small side street, and hoping to find a short cut, walks towards it. As (#pronoun) enters the side street a pack of rabid dogs come bolting down the other end, catching them by surprise, they trip backwards and are mauled. (#name) HAS DIED. 

PT.3 CH.3.1
**"blindly walk through the street, hoping to find what your looking for"**
(#name) fumbles down the street, blindly looking for a letter box or something to help find the place they search for. Instead, they fall down an open manhole in the road... What's with all these manholes? (#name) wonders to themselves as they fall to their death. (#name) HAS DIED. 

PT.3 CH.3.2
"**there was a dirty old bag back in the park, maybe it had a flash light? go check?** "
(#name) remembers seeing an old tattered bag back in the park, it's a long shot but perhaps there is a flashlight in there. (#name) runs back to check the bag, almost running directly into an old man ... He startles, looking up.. then, like he read their mind, he pulls a flash light from his coat pocket. (#name) smiles at him, and asks if he would be so kind as to accompany you back down the dark street. He accepts and passes the flashlight to (#name). Arriving back in the street, (#name) shines the flashlight down the street as they walk along, narrowly avoiding a large manhole in the street. "That could have been dangerous" says the old man as (#name) nods in agreement. Eventually the man points at a house, signalling it's his stop... (#name) graciously waits for him to go inside, he says to keep the flashlight, (#name) thanks him again as he disappears behind the door. 
What do you want to do? 

1. use the flashlight to find the address on the piece of paper (GO TO: PT5CH1.1)
2. go back and ask the old man for a glass of water, walking is thirsty work (GO TO: PT5CH1.2)

PT.3 CH.3.3
**"check the warehouse, maybe someone is working late"**
(#name) walks carefully towards the warehouse, trying to make small steps incase of any rogue man holes that may be lurking... (#name) inches closer and closer to the warehouse, arms out in front of (#pronoun) awkwardly pawing at the air. Making out the outline of the warehouse (#name) estimates it must be about 100 meters away at this point... Something catches the sleeve of (#name)'s coat and yanks them back, they fall and yank at their sleeve to try to release their coat from whatever it is caught on... One final yank and something rumbles, the coat was caught on the metal awning of a rickety water tank, the final yank causes it to topple over and crush (#name). (#name) HAS DIED. 

PT.4 CH.1.1
**"follow the man's instructions, even if he seems unsure"**
""#{name} decides the man probably knows what he is talking about, and follows the left street. The man hobbles along beside #{name}, still remeniscing about his life, the road winds down for what feels like a long time, (#name) asks the man if he notices anything familiar around the area but the man appears not to hear them and continues with his story... not wanting to be rude (#name) continues to listen to the man as they walk straight off the edge of a cliff. #{name} HAS DIED. ""

PT.4 CH.1.2
**"go the other way"**
(#name) decides not to listen to the man and kindly guides him down the right street. It's quite dark but as they continue down the street, the old man pulls out a flashlight, handing it to (#name). Shining the light around (#name) wonders whether this was the right choice of street, but the thought is cut off as the old man signals with a pointed finger, "That's my house!". (#name) smiles and walks the man to his front garden, offering back the flashlight. He smiles and pushes it back toward (#name), "You need it more then me!" he chuckles and heads into his home. 
What do you want to do? 

1. use the flashlight to find the address on the piece of paper (GO TO: PT5CH1.1)
2. go back and ask the old man for a glass of water, walking is thirsty work (GO TO: PT5CH1.2)

PT.5 CH.1.1
**"use the flashlight to find the address on the piece of paper"** 
Using the flashlight, (#name) peers down at the piece of paper. Looking up to read the mans house number, (#name) moves slowly backwards, shining the flashlight around to try to find it. There doesn't appear to be one, so (#name) moves onto the next house. Like some sort of sick joke it appears that none of the houses have visible numbers... the flashlight starts to flicker, and then goes out. (#name) slaps the light against their palm, unable to get it working (#name) tucks it in their coat pocket. As they gingerly make their next step air flows from beneath them... another manhole!!??! (#name) HAS DIED. 

PT.5 CH.1.2
**"go back and ask the old man for a glass of water, walking is thirsty work"**
As (#name) starts back towards the street, they stop and turn back to the old mans house...  Feeling a little thirsty from the walk, and the cold biting through their jacket, (#name) decides to ask the old man for a glass of water, and maybe for another story. The old man answers the door, there is a fire crackling in the background and (#name) can feel the warmth coming from within. The old man happily obliges and stands aside as (#name) enters his home. Sitting by the fire he brings (#name) a cup of tea and asks what it is they are trying to find. Handing him the piece of paper, (#name) tells him they're not sure what it was exactly, just that they had been feeling a little lost lately and a colleague had given them this address with little instruction - just that (#name) would find what they were missing. The old man smiles and leans back in his chair and says ... "Well, we haven't properly introduced ourselves, I am the Wish Granter, and I can grant you three wishes."
